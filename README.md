## Announcement if you use PolyMC.

### Poly MC its self isn't compromised, the developer banned all the project maintainers for "political views".

### PolyMC is safe to use just make sure to change your metadata server to multiMC or some other meta server you trust.

### I would recommend switching from PolyMC to Prism Launcher (A fork made by the old developers who where banned.)
